This simple project checks if there are any files with incorrect names on the local filesystem. It may sound strange, but I've experienced a strange situation when a web browser saved an .html file and somehow managed to put pipes ('|') to the filename. And such a filename (containg a pipe character) became a huge problem for all other applications. It was not easy to remove/rename the file.

This simple app doesn't solve the problem, it just tells you that there are files with incorrect names.
